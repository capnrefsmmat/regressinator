The regressinator is a simulation system designed to make it easy to simulate
different regression scenarios. By specifying the true population distribution
of the predictors, and giving the exact relationship between predictors and
response variables, we can simulate samples from the population easily. We can
use these samples to explore questions like:

1. What do different diagnostic plots look like with different kinds of model
   misspecification?
2. How do regression estimators behave with different populations?
3. What happens to estimators when their assumptions are violated?


The regressinator is also a diagnostic package for regression models. Once a
model is fit, it provides tools to extract various kind of residuals in
convenient (tidy) form, to simulate from the sampling distribution of any
desired model parameter, and to conduct simulation-based inference on the model
fit, including visual inference with lineups.

The regressinator is intended for use in the classroom, as a tool for students
to learn about regression in lab activities or homework assignments. Its
flexibility makes it suitable for any regression course where students are
expected to regularly use R.


## Population setup

Each simulation begins by specifying a population: the true population
distribution the regression data comes from. Typically this is an infinite
population of individuals whose covariates follow specified distributions. The
outcome variable is defined to be a function of those covariates with some
error. We use the `population()` function to define a population. For instance,
this population has a simple linear relationship between two predictor
variables, `x1` and `x2`, and the response variable `y`:

```{r}
library(regressinator)

linear_pop <- population(
  x1 = predictor("rnorm", mean = 4, sd = 10),
  x2 = predictor("runif", min = 0, max = 10),
  y = response(
    0.7 + 2.2 * x1 - 0.2 * x2, # relationship between X and Y
    family = gaussian(),       # link function and response distribution
    error_scale = 1.5          # errors are scaled by this amount
  )
)
```

Notice how the predictors are defined using `predictor()`, each specifying its
distribution (via the name of the R function used to simulate it, such as
`rnorm()`) and any arguments to that distribution, such as mean or standard
deviation. The response variable is defined by `response()`, whose first
argument gives `y` as a function of the predictors. This expression can refer to
the predictors by name, and will be used to simulate the response when sampling
from the population. We can also specify the link and error scale. By default,
the error distribution is Gaussian, and as the `gaussian()` family has errors
with variance 1 by default, setting the `error_scale` to 1.5 means the errors
have standard deviation 1.5.

More generally, `population()` defines a population according to the following
relationship:

$$
\begin{align*}
Y &\sim \text{SomeDistribution} \\
g(\mathbb{E}[Y \mid X = x]) &= \mu(x) \\
\mu(x) &= \text{any function of } x.
\end{align*}
$$

The function $\mu(x)$ is the first argument to `response()`, and can be any
arbitrary R expression. The distribution is given by the `family` argument, just
like families of GLMs in `glm()`. If no family is provided, the default family
is Gaussian, i.e. normally distributed errors, and the link function $g$ is the
identity.

We can hence specify a population with binary outcomes and logistic link
function:

```{r}
logistic_pop <- population(
  x1 = predictor("rnorm", mean = 0, sd = 10),
  x2 = predictor("runif", min = 0, max = 10),
  y = response(0.7 + 2.2 * x1 - 0.2 * x2,
               family = binomial(link = "logit"))
)
```

This population specifies that

$$
\begin{align*}
Y &\sim \text{Bernoulli}\left(\text{logit}^{-1}(\mu(X))\right) \\
\mu(X) &= 0.7 + 2.2 X_1 - 0.2 X_2.
\end{align*}
$$

The regressinator supports the `gaussian()`, `binomial()`, and `poisson()`
families from base R, and can draw response variables accordingly.

### Custom response distributions

It's often useful to simulate data with non-standard response distributions, so
we can investigate how estimators and diagnostics behave under different kinds
of misspecification. The regressinator provides several custom response families
to support this.

First, we can represent heteroskedasticity (unequal variance) in linear
regression by using the `error_scale` argument to `response()`. This argument is
evaluated in the sampled data frame's environment, meaning it can be written in
terms of the predictors. For example:

```{r}
heteroskedastic_pop <- population(
  x1 = predictor("rnorm", mean = 5, sd = 4),
  x2 = predictor("runif", min = 0, max = 10),
  y = response(
    4 + 2 * x1 - 3 * x2, # relationship between X and Y
    family = ols_with_error(rnorm), # distribution of the errors
    error_scale = 0.5 + x2 / 10 # errors depend on x2
  )
)
```

Next, the `ols_with_error()` family represents an identity link function with
custom error distribution. For instance, in this population, the errors are
$t$-distributed with 3 degrees of freedom:

```{r}
heavy_tail_pop <- population(
  x1 = predictor("rnorm", mean = 5, sd = 4),
  x2 = predictor("runif", min = 0, max = 10),
  y = response(
    4 + 2 * x1 - 3 * x2, # relationship between X and Y
    family = ols_with_error(rt, df = 3), # distribution of the errors
    error_scale = 1.0 # errors are multiplied by this scale factor
  )
)
```

Again, we can use `error_scale` to scale the error distribution to change its
overall variance, and the `error_scale` can depend on the predictors.

Finally, use `custom_family()` to represent a completely arbitrary relationship,
as defined by the response distribution and inverse link function. For instance,
a zero-inflated Poisson family:

```{r}
# 40% of draws have lambda = 0, the rest have lambda given by the inverse link
zeroinfpois <- function(ys) {
  n <- length(ys)
  rpois(n, lambda = ys * rbinom(n, 1, prob = 0.4))
}

pop <- population(
  x1 = predictor("rnorm", mean = 2, sd = 2),
  y = response(
    0.7 + 0.8 * x1,
    family = custom_family(zeroinfpois, exp)
  )
)
```

Here `y` is sampled by evaluating `zeroinfpois(exp(0.7 + 0.8 * x1))`, and so 40%
of the draws will be 0, and the rest will come from `rpois(lambda = exp(0.7 +
0.8 * x1))`. This approach could also be used to simulate contaminated error
distributions, inject outliers, or produce other unusual error patterns.

### Categorical predictors

R supports many common probability distributions, so most common predictor
variable distributions can be specified. But categorical predictor variables
(factors) are very common in practice, and so the regressinator provides
`rfactor()` for drawing factor variables:

```{r}
# default is equally likely levels
rfactor(5, c("foo", "bar", "baz"))

# but probabilities per level can be specified
rfactor(5, c("foo", "bar", "baz"), c(0.4, 0.3, 0.3))
```

Then, using the `by_level()` helper, we can use factors in defining a regression
model. For instance, here is a model with a different intercept per group:

```{r}
intercepts <- c("foo" = 2, "bar" = 30, "baz" = 7)

factor_intercept_pop <- population(
  group = predictor("rfactor",
                    levels = c("foo", "bar", "baz"),
                    prob = c(0.1, 0.6, 0.3)),
  x = predictor("runif", min = 0, max = 10),
  y = response(by_level(group, intercepts) + 0.3 * x,
               error_scale = 1.5)
)
```

Or, similarly, a model with a different slope per group:

```{r}
slopes <- c("foo" = 2, "bar" = 30, "baz" = 7)

factor_slope_pop <- population(
  group = predictor("rfactor",
                    levels = c("foo", "bar", "baz"),
                    prob = c(0.1, 0.6, 0.3)),
  x = predictor("runif", min = 0, max = 10),
  y = response(7 + by_level(group, slopes) * x,
               error_scale = 1.5)
)
```

## Sampling from the population

We can use `sample_x()` to get a sample from a population. `sample_y()` then
works on this sample and adds a `y` column, following the relationship specified
in the population.

```{r}
linear_samp <- sample_y(sample_x(linear_pop, n = 10))
```

Sampling X and Y is separated because often, in regression theory, we treat X as
fixed -- hence we want to conduct simulations where the same X data is used and
we repeatedly draw new Y values according to the population relationship.

We can also use R pipes to put together simulations:

```{r}
logistic_pop |>
  sample_x(n = 10) |>
  sample_y()
```

The object this produces is a standard data frame (just with a few extra
attributes), so it can be given to `lm()`, `glm()`, or any other standard
modeling function that uses data frames.

## Fitting models

After we simulate a sample from a population, we can fit our chosen models to
that sample. That model may simply use the predictors as-is, entering them into
the design matrix and obtaining estimates through least square or maximum
likelihood. But it is also common to represent the predictors differently in the
model:

* Factor predictors are typically represented as several columns, for instance
  with one-hot encoding
* Predictors might be transformed, so the transformed version enters the model
* To fit a polynomial or spline, we might use several transformations of the
  predictor in the model (such as linear, squared, and cubed terms)

We call these transformed and recoded variables *regressors*. The coefficients
of a model give the relationship between the *regressors* and the response, but
the regressors may be transformed versions of the predictors. Many conventional
diagnostics are based on the regressors, such as most residual plots, but as we
will see below, others directly examine the relationship between the predictors
and the response, however those predictors have been transformed and entered
into the model.

We can, in principle, do almost any regression we desire. The only constraint is
that we must use the `data` argument to our modeling function (such as `lm()` or
`glm()`) to provide the data. That is, we must do this:

```{r}
fit <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = linear_samp)
```

But **not** this:

```{r}
fit <- lm(linear_samp$y ~ linear_samp$x1 + linear_samp$x2)
```

Using the `data` argument allows the regressinator to conduct simulations by
passing new data in that argument; if you don't use it and refer to your local
environment, there's no reliable way to change the data in your model. The
relevant functions will automatically detect models without a `data` argument
and complain.

## Producing diagnostics

Once we have a sample and fit a model, we can conduct diagnostics. Simple
diagnostic plots can easily be made using `broom::augment()`, which generates a
data frame with columns including the predictors, residuals, standardized
residuals, fitted value, and other useful statistics for each observation. It
also works for many common types of models; see the [broom
documentation](https://broom.tidymodels.org/) for details.

For example, consider a simple dataset where the true relationship between `x1`
and `y` is not linear. We can quickly plot residuals versus fitted values:

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
library(broom)

nonlinear_pop <- population(
  x1 = predictor("runif", min = 1, max = 8),
  x2 = predictor("runif", min = 0, max = 10),
  y = response(0.7 + x1**2 - x2, family = gaussian(),
               error_scale = 4.0)
)

nonlinear_data <- nonlinear_pop |>
  sample_x(n = 100) |>
  sample_y()

nonlinear_fit <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = nonlinear_data)

# to see the kind of information we get from an augmented fit
augment(nonlinear_fit)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(augment(nonlinear_fit),
       aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Fitted value", y = "Residual")
```

The regressinator builds on these tools to support additional diagnostics. For
example, `augment_longer()` is like `broom::augment()`, but produces one row per
regressor per observation, essentially putting the data in "long" format. This
makes it easy to facet the data to plot residuals against each regressor:

```{r, fig.height=4}
ggplot(augment_longer(nonlinear_fit),
       aes(x = .predictor_value, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(vars(.predictor_name), scales = "free") +
  labs(x = "Predictor value", y = "Residual")
```

Partial residuals are an extension of ordinary residuals that are defined in
terms of the original predictors, not the regressors; we can think of a partial
residual plot for a particular predictor as showing the relationship between
that predictor and the response, after "adjusting for" the other predictors
according to our fitted model. The `partial_residuals()` function calculates
partial residuals in tidy format, and its documentation provides detailed
references on the use and interpretation of partial residuals.

Here the black line gives the fitted predictor effects (i.e. the model estimate
of the relationship), while the blue line smooths the partial residuals. We can
see that for `x1`, the blue line deviates systematically from the black line in
a quadratic shape:

```{r, fig.height=4}
ggplot(partial_residuals(nonlinear_fit),
       aes(x = .predictor_value, y = .partial_resid)) +
  geom_point() + # partial residuals
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + # smoothed residuals
  geom_line(aes(x = .predictor_value, y = .predictor_effect)) + # effects
  facet_wrap(vars(.predictor_name), scales = "free") +
  labs(x = "Predictor value", y = "Partial residual")
```

If we fit a quadratic model for `x1`, the partial residuals reflect this. The
black line for the effect of `x1` is now quadratic, and the partial residuals
closely follow it:

```{r fig.height=4}
quadratic_fit <- lm(y ~ poly(x1, 2) + x2, data = nonlinear_data)

ggplot(partial_residuals(quadratic_fit),
       aes(x = .predictor_value, y = .partial_resid)) +
  geom_point() + # partial residuals
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + # smoothed residuals
  geom_line(aes(x = .predictor_value, y = .predictor_effect)) + # effects
  facet_wrap(vars(.predictor_name), scales = "free") +
  labs(x = "Predictor value", y = "Partial residual")
```

These diagnostic functions work for linear models and also GLMs fit by `glm()`.
See `vignette("linear-regression-diagnostics")` and
`vignette("logistic-regression-diagnostics")` for further diagnostic examples.

## Visual inference

It can be difficult to tell whether a particular pattern in model diagnostics
signifies a real problem or just an unlucky pattern. To help make this judgment,
the regressinator provides the `model_lineup()` function. It takes a model fit
and does the following:

1. Get the diagnostics from that model, using `broom::augment()` by default.
2. Simulate 19 additional datasets using the model, using the standard
   assumptions for that model. (For instance, for linear regression, errors are
   drawn from a normal distribution.) In each dataset, the same X values are
   used, and only new Y values are drawn. Each dataset is the same size.
3. For each of those datasets, fit the same model and calculate the diagnostics.
4. Put the diagnostics for all 20 fits into one data frame with a `.sample`
   column indicating which fit each diagnostic came from.
5. Print out a message indicating how to tell which of the `.sample` values
   comes from the original model.

This helps us compare how diagnostic plots will look when assumptions hold (by
looking at the 19 simulated datasets) to how the diagnostic plots of our real
model look. This visual inference approach is taken from the
[nullabor](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nullabor) package.

For example, consider the same dataset where the true relationship is not
linear, but we use a linear fit. We can quickly plot residuals versus fitted
values:

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
model_lineup(nonlinear_fit) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(vars(.sample)) +
  labs(x = "Fitted value", y = "Residual")
```

The user can examine the 20 plots and guess which one represents the model fit
to the original data, and which are generated assuming the fitted model is
correct. The `decrypt()` code provided will print out a message indicating which
of the plots is the real data; in this case, it's the plot with the clear
quadratic trend in the residuals.

This approach can be used to explore different kind of misspecification. For
example, using `ols_with_error()` we can test whether we can spot non-normal
residual distributions in residual Q-Q plots:

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
heavy_tail_pop <- population(
  x1 = predictor("rnorm", mean = 5, sd = 4),
  x2 = predictor("runif", min = 0, max = 10),
  y = response(
    4 + 2 * x1 - 3 * x2,
    family = ols_with_error(rt, df = 3),
    error_scale = 1.0
  )
)

heavy_tail_sample <- heavy_tail_pop |>
  sample_x(n = 100) |>
  sample_y()

fit <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = heavy_tail_sample)

model_lineup(fit) |>
  ggplot(aes(sample = .resid)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  facet_wrap(vars(.sample)) +
  labs(x = "Theoretical quantiles", y = "Observed quantiles")
```

Here we have Q-Q plots of residuals for a linear regression where the true
relationship is linear, but the error distribution is $t_3$. This is a good way
to see if we can spot the heavy-tailed distribution from among the 19 other Q-Q
plots that simulate normally distributed errors.

## Sampling distributions

The `sampling_distribution()` function allows you to explore the sampling
distribution of statistics and estimates from models fit to a population. Given
a dataset drawn from a `population()` and a model fit to that data, it will:

1. Draw repeated samples from the population. These can be with the predictors
   held fixed, only resampling the response, or can be new samples of predictors
   and response jointly. Each sample is the same size as the original dataset.
2. For each sample, refit the model to that sample.
3. For each model fit, apply a function to get features of the model fit.
4. Combine all the results into a single data frame.

By default, the function applied to each fit is `broom::tidy()`, which can take
many types of model fits and produce a data frame of the model coefficients and
their standard errors.

We can hence explore the sampling distribution of estimates fit to samples from
a population:

```{r}
d <- linear_pop |>
  sample_x(n = 30) |>
  sample_y()

fit <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = d)
tidy(fit)

sampling_distribution(fit, d, nsim = 4)
```

Because the output is a tidy data frame, it's easy to visualize the full
sampling distributions:

```{r, fig.height=4}
samples <- sampling_distribution(fit, d, nsim = 1000)

samples |>
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(vars(term), scales = "free") +
  labs(x = "Estimate", y = "Frequency")
```

Or to get the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

samples |>
  group_by(term) |>
  summarize(mean = mean(estimate),
            sd = sd(estimate))
```

We could use this feature to explore how sampling distributions change as we
change the sample size, change the complexity of the model, or introduce various
types of model misspecification.

## Parametric bootstrapping

The `parametric_boot_distribution()` function allows you to explore the
distribution of statistics and estimates from models fit to data *sampled from
the model fit.* Given a fitted model, it will:

1. Draw repeated samples from the model. The predictors are held fixed and the
   model is used to sample new response values, following the response and error
   distributions assumed by the model.
2. For each sample, refit a model to that sample. This could be the same model
   used to simulate the sample, for instance to explore diagnostics when the
   model is true, or an alternative model.
3. For each model fit, apply a function to get features of that model fit.
4. Combined all the results in to a single data frame.

As with `sampling_distribution()`, the default function applied to each fit is
`broom::tidy()`.

This function is used by `model_lineup()` to generate the "null" diagnostics. It
could also be used for hypothesis testing. For example, let's consider the
nonlinear example set up above. The data `nonlinear_data` comes from a
population where the true relationship between `y` and `x1` is quadratic, but
`nonlinear_fit` is a model fit with only a linear term. If we did not know a
quadratic term was necessary and wanted to conduct a test, we could use an *F*
test:

```{r}
quadratic_fit <- lm(y ~ x1 + I(x1^2) + x2, data = nonlinear_data)

anova(nonlinear_fit, quadratic_fit)
```

This suggests the quadratic term is useful, as we would expect when the true
relationship is quadratic and we have an adequate sample size. But if for some
reason we do not want to use an *F* test, or if we are teaching simulation-based
inference, we could instead use the parametric bootstrap. Under the null
hypothesis, there is no quadratic relationship, so we simulate the null
distribution of coefficient values under this null by simulating from
`nonlinear_fit` and refitting `quadratic_fit`:

```{r, fig.height=4}
quadratic_coefs <- parametric_boot_distribution(nonlinear_fit, quadratic_fit,
                                                data = nonlinear_data) |>
  filter(term == "I(x1^2)")

ggplot(quadratic_coefs, aes(x = estimate)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = coef(quadratic_fit)["I(x1^2)"],
             color = "red") +
  labs(x = "Quadratic term coefficient",
       y = "Count",
       title = "Null distribution of quadratic term")
```

We see the quadratic coefficient estimated on the original data (vertical red
line) is far larger than any of the quadratic coefficients estimated when the
null is true, leading us to reject the null hypothesis that the quadratic
coefficient is zero.
