\title{Simulate the sampling distribution of estimates from a population}
\usage{
sampling_distribution(fit, data, fn = tidy, nsim = 100, fixed_x = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A model fit to data, such as by \code{lm()} or \code{glm()}, to refit to
each sample from the population.}

\item{data}{Data drawn from a \code{population()}, using \code{sample_x()} and possibly
\code{sample_y()}. The \code{population()} specification is used to draw the samples.}

\item{fn}{Function to call on each new model fit to produce a data frame of
estimates. Defaults to \code{broom::tidy()}, which produces a tidy data frame of
coefficients, estimates, standard errors, and hypothesis tests.}

\item{nsim}{Number of simulations to run.}

\item{fixed_x}{If \code{TRUE}, the default, the predictor variables are held fixed
and only the response variables are redrawn from the population. If
\code{FALSE}, the predictor and response variables are drawn jointly.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{fn} each time it is called.}
}
\value{
Data frame (tibble) of \code{nsim + 1} simulation results, formed by
concatenating together the data frames returned by \code{fn}. The \code{.sample}
column identifies which simulated sample each row came from. Rows with
\code{.sample == 0} come from the original \code{fit}.
}
\description{
Repeatedly refits the model to new samples from the population, calculates
estimates for each fit, and compiles a data frame of the results.
}
\details{
To generate sampling distributions of different quantities, the user can
provide a custom \code{fn}. The \code{fn} should take a model fit as its argument and
return a data frame. For instance, the data frame might contain one row per
estimated coefficient and include the coefficient and its standard error; or
it might contain only one row of model summary statistics.
}
\section{Model limitations}{
Because this function uses S3 generic methods such as \code{model.frame()},
\code{simulate()}, and \code{update()}, it can be used with any model fit for which
methods are provided. In base R, this includes \code{lm()} and \code{glm()}.

The model provided as \code{fit} must be fit using the \code{data} argument to provide
a data frame. For example:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

When simulating new data, this function provides the simulated data as the
\code{data} argument and re-fits the model. If you instead refer directly to local
variables in the model formula, this will not work. For example, if you fit a
model this way:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{# will not work
fit <- lm(cars$dist ~ cars$speed)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

It will not be possible to refit the model using simulated datasets, as that
would require modifying your environment to edit \code{cars}.

  summarize(mean = mean(estimate),
            sd = sd(estimate))

# instead of coefficients, get the sampling distribution of R^2
